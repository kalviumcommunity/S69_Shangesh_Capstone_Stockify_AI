# Frontend Testing Summary for Stockify AI

## Overview
This document summarizes the Jest testing setup and implementation for the Stockify AI frontend application. We've created unit tests for all components used in the Home page to ensure UI components render correctly and behave as expected.

## Testing Setup
- **Testing Framework**: Jest
- **Testing Library**: React Testing Library
- **Configuration**: 
  - Jest configured with jsdom environment for DOM testing
  - Babel configured to handle JSX and modern JavaScript
  - Mock files created for handling image imports
  - React Router DOM mocked for component testing

## Components Tested

### Pages
1. **Home** - Tests that all child components are rendered in the correct order

### Components
1. **Navbar** - Tests logo rendering, navigation links, sign-in button, and mobile menu toggle functionality
2. **MainSection** - Tests headings, subheadings, and button rendering with correct links
3. **Mockup** - Tests image rendering with correct attributes and classes
4. **Footer** - Tests logo text, copyright text, and social media icons
5. **TickerTape** - Tests the TradingView widget with proper props passing

## Test Coverage
The current test suite covers:
- Component rendering
- Component structure and hierarchy
- User interactions (button clicks in Navbar)
- Props passing (TickerTape widget)
- Responsive design elements (mobile menu)

## Running Tests
To run the tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Future Improvements
1. Add tests for remaining pages and components
2. Implement integration tests for more complex user flows
3. Add snapshot testing for UI components
4. Implement coverage reporting to identify untested code

## Total Test Count
- 6 test files
- 13 individual test cases
- All tests passing
